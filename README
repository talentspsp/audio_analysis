This project implements plca-based sound classification system.

All the core functions use basic data type array for matrix, such like double*, which will be easy to encapsulate into other data structure, or wrap into matlab mex functions.

STFT.cpp/h: short time Fourier Transform.
plca2d.cpp/h: plca2d algorithm, the output are P(f|z), P(z), Pt(z). IT'S OUT OF DATE! USE plca.cpp/h
plca.cpp/h: plca2d algorithm.
comp_weight.cpp/h: calculate the weights of different sources in a given distribution
spuc/ and libspuc.a: library used for FFT
wavproc/ and libwavproc.a: library used for wav io
matfile.cpp/h: load and save matrix, in both ascii and binary format
math_uttil.h: some math functions
audio_analyzer.cpp/h: class for the whole system
matlab_files/: some matlab scripts used to compare and analyze data

see the test** files for the usage of the class and functions, and also the usage of the functions are commented in the source files.

The intermediate results, such like results of plca or STFT, can be got with the get_** functions and saved with the functions in matfile.cpp/h.
